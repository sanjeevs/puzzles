## Center of Gravity of Triangle
Find the point at which you can balance a solid triangle.
This would be the center of gravity, which is the point of intersection of medians.

### Material Required
1. Solid Triangle. Maybe cut from thick cardboard.
2. Pencil, Ruler to find the median.

Demostrate the relation that for a bar it is 1:1, triangle there is ratio 2:1, for a tetrahedron is 3:1?

## Infinity
If you remove a little from infinity then it is still infinity. So use it to solve infinity fractions like
1 + 1/(1 + 1/(1 + 1/...)). This is like function composition with x = 1 + 1/x.

## Pendlum Experiment
Calculate g from the time period of a pendlum?
An engineer builds two simple pendula. Both are suspended from small wires secured to the ceiling of a room. Each pendulum hovers 2 cm above the floor. Pendulum 1 has a bob with a mass of 10 kg. Pendulum 2 has a bob with a mass of 100 kg. Describe how the motion of the pendula will differ if the bobs are both displaced by 12ยบ.

## Monkey pulley problem
